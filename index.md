## About Me

I am Mintong Kang, a first-year Ph.D. student at [UIUC CS (https://cs.illinois.edu/)] advised by Prof. [Bo Li (https://aisecure.github.io/)].
My research interest lies in the **intersection of machine learning and robustness, fairness, generalization**.

Before that, I got the bachlor of engineering degree from the CS department of [Zhejiang University (https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)]. 
I work with Prof. [Xi Li (https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/xilics)] on continual learning at DCD Lab @ Zhejiang University. I also luckily work with Prof. [Alan L. Yuille (https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/)] at [CCVL Lab (https://ccvl.jhu.edu/team/)] @ Johns Hopkins University.

<!-- ## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->

## News

- **[Sep. 2022]** Two papers accepted to NeurIPS 2022.
- **[Aug. 2022]** Began study at UIUC.
- **[Jun. 2022]** Graduated from CS department of Zhejian University.
