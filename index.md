## About Me

I am Mintong Kang, a first-year Ph.D. student at [UIUC CS (https://cs.illinois.edu/)] advised by Prof. [Bo Li (https://aisecure.github.io/)].
My research interest lies in the **intersection of machine learning and robustness, fairness, generalization**.

Before that, I got the bachlor of engineering degree from the CS department of [Zhejiang University (https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/)]. 
I work with Prof. [Xi Li (https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/xilics)] on continual learning at DCD Lab @ Zhejiang University. I also luckily work with Prof. [Alan L. Yuille (https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/)] at [CCVL Lab (https://ccvl.jhu.edu/team/)] @ Johns Hopkins University.
