## About Me

I am Mintong Kang, a third-year Ph.D. student at [UIUC CS](https://cs.illinois.edu/) advised by Prof. [Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/).
My research interest lies in trustworthy machine learning and AI safety. I am interested in uncovering the vulnerability of advanced ML models and developing certifiable defense mechanisms to safeguard their universal deployments. I am recently working on the trustworthiness of multi-modal models (VLM, audio/video LLMs) and LLM agent systems.

[//]: # (My research interest lies in **trustworthy machine learning including robustness, fairness, and uncertainty quantification**.)

[//]: # (Recently, I am interested in the trustworthiness properties of *large language models* and *diffusion models*. )

[//]: # (I am working on exploring the vulnerabilities of them and develop more robust and reliable applications with them in practice.)

Before that, I got the bachelor of engineering degree from the CS department of [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). 
I work with Prof. [Xi Li](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=TYNPJQMAAAAJ&hl=en) at DCD Lab @ Zhejiang University. I also luckily work with Prof. [Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) at [CCVL Lab](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/team/) @ Johns Hopkins University.
